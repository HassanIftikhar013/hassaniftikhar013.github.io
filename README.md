## Hassan Iftikhar
### Ph.D. Candidate, Dept. of Biomedical Engineering | The Ohio State University


I work on developing and applying signal processing, optimization, and deep 
learning techniques for solving inverse problems in magnetic resonance 
elastography (MRE). My doctoral research focuses on 
accurate and rapid stiffness estimation using FEM-driven simulation pipelines, 
physics-informed inverse problem formulations, and accelerated MRE acquisition 
and reconstruction strategies such as simultaneous multislice (SMS-MRE). 

I also work extensively on recovering high-quality stiffness maps from 
noisy and highly aliased MRE-wave images through a combination of deep learning models 
(DIME, 3D-DIME) and DL-based reconstruction. My work integrates 
MRE physics simulation using FEM, and Deep Learning to improve robustness and 
clinical feasibility of MRE stiffness mapping. 

I am co-advised by **Prof. Rizwan Ahmad** and **Prof. Arunark Kolipaka** at 
The Ohio State University.

## 🧪 Research Projects


### 1️⃣    DIME – Deep Learning Driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE

[![DIME Project Thumbnail](images/dime.png)](#)

- Trains a U-Net–style model on FEM-generated phantoms to reconstruct shear modulus maps from complex-valued displacement fields. 
- Evaluated on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and anatomy-informed phantoms as well as in vivo liver MRE data.
- Demonstrated:
  - High correlation with ground truth stiffness
  - Reduced bias vs. traditional inversion methods
  - Sharper recovery of localized stiffness changes (e.g., inclusions, focal lesions)
  - Performance for in vivo liver applications
- Status:
  - Journal manuscript *“DIME: Deep Learning Driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in Magnetic Resonance Elastography”* under review in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (MRM)

- Code: [**Github Code Link**](https://github.com/HassanIftikhar013/DIME)

### 2️⃣    3D-DIME – Extension of DIME for 3D MR Elastography

[![3D-DIME Project Thumbnail](images/3d-dime.png)](#)

- Extends the DIME framework from 2D slices to 3D MRE acquisitions, improving anatomical consistency across slices.
- Trained on 3D volumetric FEM phantoms for liver and brain applications, incorporating realistic anatomy and material heterogeneity.
- Status:
   - Proof of technique demonstrated in abstract submitted to **ISMRM 2026** focusing on 3D stiffness reconstruction performance. [**Abstract Link**](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/iftikhar_15_buckeyemail_osu_edu/IQB19sSnAYfGS6msOVQwUyv5ASnUST0Gdahftx7S7CFtJkE?e=vs2JRO)
  -  3D-MRE acquisition for breast tumour application is in process.
