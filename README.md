## Hassan Iftikhar
### Ph.D. Candidate, Dept. of Biomedical Engineering | The Ohio State University


I work on developing and applying signal processing, optimization, and deep 
learning techniques for solving inverse problems in magnetic resonance 
elastography (MRE). My doctoral research focuses on 
accurate and rapid stiffness estimation using FEM-driven simulation pipelines, 
physics-informed inverse problem formulations, and accelerated MRE acquisition 
and reconstruction strategies such as simultaneous multislice (SMS-MRE). 

I also work extensively on recovering high-quality stiffness maps from 
noisy and highly aliased MRE-wave images through a combination of deep learning models 
(DIME, 3D-DIME) and DL-based reconstruction. My work integrates 
MRE physics simulation using FEM, and Deep Learning to improve robustness and 
clinical feasibility of MRE stiffness mapping. 

I am co-advised by **Prof. Rizwan Ahmad** and **Prof. Arunark Kolipaka** at 
The Ohio State University.

### 1️⃣ DIME – Deep Learning Driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE

[![DIME Project Thumbnail](images/dime.png)](#)
**Deep learning framework to estimate stiffness maps from MRE wavefields.**

- Trains a U-Net–style model on **FEM-generated phantoms** to reconstruct shear modulus maps from complex-valued displacement fields. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Evaluated on **homogeneous, heterogeneous, and anatomy-informed phantoms** as well as **in vivo liver MRE data**.
- Demonstrated:
  - High correlation with ground truth stiffness
  - Reduced bias vs. traditional inversion methods
  - Sharper recovery of localized stiffness changes (e.g., inclusions, focal lesions)
- Status:
  - Journal manuscript *“DIME: Deep Learning Driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in Magnetic Resonance Elastography”* under review. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
